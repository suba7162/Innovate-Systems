## Swimming Pool Membership and Lesson Booking System ##

A club’s swim school currently has five swimming instructors, Jeff, Anna, Peter, Michael and Kerry. All the members in the club can book as many private swimming lessons as they like with any of the swimming instructors through the staff in the club. The swimming lessons are available from 9am to 5pm on working days, and the duration of a swimming lesson is one hour.

The program will be used by the staff in the club to manage the swimming lessons booking. The program should have a main menu that allows the staff

* to book a swimming lesson for a club member
* to cancel a swimming lesson
* to display the current schedule of a swimming instructor (An example of current schedule is shown in Figure 1. In the current schedule, ‘x’ indicates that the time slot has been booked by another member.)
* to display all time slots that are available for booking (An example is shown in Figure 2. In the figure, ‘x’ means no swimming instructor is available in the time slot, ‘J/A/P/M/K’ means J (Jeff), A (Anna), P(Peter), M (Michael) and K(Kerry) are all available in the time slot, ‘J/A/P’ means J (Jeff), A (Anna), and P(Peter) are all available in the time slot, but M (Michael) and K(Kerry) are not available in the time slot.)
